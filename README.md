# Link-Prediction-in-Social-Network
The project is focused on predicting future or missing links in a social network using supervised machine learning.

# Problem Overview
Link Prediction is important in many domains such as recommendation systems, bio-informatics or fraud detection. The real-life scenario was simulated by hiding part of the edges in social network to predict them based on node features and graph structure.

# Dataset
- Graph: Synthetic social network with 1500 nodes and 7333 links. The network was generated by removing ~10% of the links of an original network (only 6600 links are visible).
- Node Attributes: categorical feature that can take 5 possible values
- Test Set: 1466 links of which 733 exist in the original network (positive examples) and 733 do not exist in the original network (negative examples)

# Methodology
### 1. Feature Engineering
Features for node pairs were extracted: Common Neighbors, Jaccard Coefficient, Adamic-Adar Index, Preferential Attachment, Katz-Index, Attribute Similarity,
Resource Allocation Index
### 2. Data Preparation
- Positive examples (Observed links) and Negative Examples (non-observed links)
- Balanced dataset
- Train/validation split with 5-cross fold.
### 3. Model Selection
-Logistic Regression
-Gradient Boosting
-Random Forest Classifier (final model)

# Results
-Accuracy = 0.872
-Precision = 0.850
-Recall = 0.903
-F1 score = 0.876 
-AUC = 0.93
Katz-Index was the most predictive feature in selected model followed by Preferential Attatchment and Attribute Similarity.
